# IDC621 Modelling Complex Systems

This repository contains code for the course IDC621: Modelling Complex Systems taken by Dr. Sudeshna Sinha at IISER Mohali during the academic year 2025-2026.

## A Note
All code for the course will be written in Julia which I am not very good at currently. So initially a lot of the code might be absolutely noobish for someone who comes from a good Julia background. This is just a way to improve my understanding of Julia and how to write idiomatic code in it.
